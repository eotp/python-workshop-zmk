    "* Simple to understand and to interpret (white box model). Trees can be visualized.\n",

    "* The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",

    "Learning the parameters of a prediction function and testing it on the same data is a methodological mistake: a model that would just repeat the labels of the samples that it has just seen would have a perfect score but would fail to predict anything useful on yet-unseen data. This situation is called __overfitting__. To avoid it, it is common practice when performing a (supervised) machine learning experiment to hold out part of the available data as a test set `X_test`, `y_test`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating different settings (__*hyperparameters*__) for estimators,there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance. To solve this problem, yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called __“validation set”__: training proceeds on the training set, after which evaluation is done on the validation set, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by partitioning the available data into three sets, we drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is a procedure called [__cross-validation__][1] (__CV__ for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV. In the basic approach, called __k-fold CV__, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). \n",
    "\n",
    "The __performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop__. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as it is the case when fixing an arbitrary test set), which is a major advantage in problem such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small.\n",

    "[Gradient Tree Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) (GBT) is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. GBT is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of GBT are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features)\n",
    "* Predictive power\n",
    "* Robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "In __boosting methods__, base estimators are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. The motivation is to combine several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn's [`GradientBoostingClassifier`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html) implementation, the number of weak learners (i.e. regression trees) is controlled by the parameter `n_estimators`; The size of each tree can be controlled either by setting the tree depth via `max_depth` or by setting the number of leaf nodes via `max_leaf_nodes`. The `learning_rate` is a hyper-parameter in the range `(0.0, 1.0]` that controls overfitting via shrinkage."
